# Privacy Policy for ForkIt

**Last Updated:** January 7, 2026

## Introduction

ForkIt ("we," "our," or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the ForkIt mobile application.

## Information We Collect

### Location Data

ForkIt collects and uses your device's location data to provide the core functionality of the app:

- **Precise Location (GPS)**: Used to find nearby restaurants within your selected radius
- **Approximate Location**: Used as a fallback if precise location is unavailable

**How we use location data:**
- Finding restaurants near you using the Google Places API
- Calculating distances to restaurant locations
- Filtering search results based on your selected radius

**Location data handling:**
- Location data is processed in real-time and is NOT stored on our servers
- Location data is NOT shared with third parties (except Google Places API for search functionality)
- Location data is ephemeral (temporary) and only used during your active session
- No location history is maintained

### Data NOT Collected

ForkIt does NOT collect, store, or process:
- Personal identifying information (name, email, phone number)
- User accounts or login credentials
- Payment information
- Device identifiers
- Usage analytics or behavior tracking
- Crash reports or diagnostic data (in current version)

## Third-Party Services

### Google Places API

ForkIt uses the Google Places API to:
- Search for nearby restaurants
- Retrieve restaurant details (name, rating, price, hours, phone number)
- Provide location-based services

When you use ForkIt, your location data is sent to Google Places API in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy:
https://policies.google.com/privacy

**Note:** We do not control Google's data practices. Please review Google's Privacy Policy to understand how they handle data.

### External Links

ForkIt provides links to:
- Google Maps (for navigation)
- Recipe websites (YouTube, Google Search, Allrecipes)

When you click these links, you leave the ForkIt app and are subject to the privacy policies of those external services.

## Data Storage

- **Local Storage Only**: All app preferences and filter settings are stored locally on your device
- **No Cloud Sync**: ForkIt does not use cloud storage or remote databases
- **No Server-Side Storage**: We do not operate servers that store user data

## Permissions

ForkIt requests the following Android permissions:

1. **ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION** - For precise GPS location
2. **ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION** - For approximate location (fallback)
3. **INTERNET** - To communicate with Google Places API

You can revoke these permissions at any time through your device settings. If you deny location permissions, the app will not function as it requires location to search for nearby restaurants.

## Children's Privacy

ForkIt is intended for users aged 13 and older. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has used the app, please contact us.

## Data Security

- All network communications use HTTPS encryption
- Location data is transmitted securely to Google Places API
- No user data is stored on remote servers
- No user authentication system (no passwords to protect)

## Data Retention

- **Location Data**: Not retained (ephemeral, used only during active session)
- **Filter Preferences**: Stored locally on device until app is uninstalled
- **Search History**: Not stored

## User Rights

### Data Deletion

Since ForkIt does not collect or store personal data on remote servers:
- Uninstalling the app removes all locally stored data
- No account deletion is necessary (no accounts exist)
- No server-side data to request deletion of

### Data Access

You can view all data ForkIt stores by checking your device's local app storage. No remote data access is available because no remote data is stored.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do:
- The "Last Updated" date will be revised
- Material changes will be communicated through app updates
- Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance

## Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)

For users in the European Economic Area (EEA):
- **Legal Basis**: Legitimate interest and consent
- **Purpose**: Provide location-based restaurant search functionality
- **Data Minimization**: We only process location data necessary for core functionality
- **Right to Object**: You can deny location permissions to stop processing

## California Privacy Rights (CCPA)

For California residents:
- ForkIt does not "sell" personal information
- ForkIt does not collect personal information beyond location data (which is not stored)
- No opt-out mechanism is needed as data is not sold or stored

## International Data Transfers

Location data sent to Google Places API may be transferred internationally in accordance with Google's data practices. ForkIt itself does not transfer data internationally as we do not operate servers.
