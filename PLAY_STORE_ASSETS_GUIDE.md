### Full Description
**Limit:** 4000 characters
**ForkIt Full Description:**

```
Can't decide where to eat? Fork it. 🍴

ForkIt removes food decision fatigue by choosing a restaurant for you—no scrolling, no analysis paralysis. Just tap "Fork It" and we'll pick one spot from your filtered preferences.

🎯 TRUE RANDOM SELECTION
One button. One choice. Done. No browsing, no second-guessing.

🏡 MAKE IT AT HOME FALLBACK
Every pick includes the restaurant's signature dish + copycat recipe links. Don't want to go out? Recreate the vibe at home.

✨ HIDDEN GEMS MODE
Prioritizes local restaurants over chains. Discover your neighborhood.

🎚️ SMART FILTERS (NOT BROWSING TOOLS)
• Distance radius (1-15 miles)
• Price range ($-$$$$)
• Minimum rating (3.5+)
• Cuisine keywords (optional)
• Open now toggle
• Hidden Gems mode

WHY FORKIT?

The problem isn't lack of information—it's decision overload. Google Maps already shows you restaurants, ratings, and reviews. What it doesn't do well: **"Just tell me where to go."**

ForkIt makes the decision *for* you, then offers a cooking fallback if you don't want to leave the house.

FEATURES

✓ Random restaurant selection with guardrails
✓ Google Maps integration for directions
✓ One-tap phone call to restaurant
✓ Signature dish identification
✓ Copycat recipe links (YouTube, Google, Allrecipes)
✓ Re-roll if you really don't vibe with the pick
✓ Playful UI with fun loading phrases
✓ Local-first with Hidden Gems prioritization

PHILOSOPHY

We're not a replacement for Google Maps search. We're the "fuck it, just pick one" button you wish existed. Decision paralysis is real. ForkIt solves it.

Fork responsibly. Tines may vary. 🍴

PRIVACY

ForkIt uses your location only to find nearby restaurants. We don't store your location data, don't require an account, and don't track your behavior. Simple as that.
