## 🎨 Detailed Post (More Engaging)

🚀 BIG NEWS! I just published my first Android app to Google Play Store! 🎉

📱 App: ForkIt - Random Restaurant Picker

🤔 The Problem:
Ever spend 30 minutes scrolling through restaurant options, unable to decide where to eat? Yeah, me too.

✨ The Solution:
ForkIt makes the decision FOR you. One tap, one choice, done.

🍴 Features:
• True random selection (with smart filters)
• Hidden Gems mode (prioritizes local restaurants over chains)

• Filter by distance, price, rating, cuisine, and more

🧪 I need BETA TESTERS!

## 💬 Casual Friend Post

Hey everyone! 👋

So... I made an app 😅

It's called ForkIt and it solves the "where should we eat?" problem by just picking a restaurant for you randomly.

I need people to test it before I launch it publicly!

Requirements:
✅ Android phone
✅ 5-10 minutes to try it
✅ Honest feedback (bugs, ideas, whatever!)

Interested? Drop a comment or send me a message and I'll hook you up with the beta link!

Fork indecision. Fork it all. 🍴

## 🎯 Tech-Focused Post (For Developer Friends)

```
🚀 Shipped my first production app to Google Play Store!

Project: ForkIt - A decision-making app for restaurant selection
Tech Stack: React Native, Expo, Google Places API, EAS Build
Platform: Android (iOS coming later)

Built to solve analysis paralysis when choosing where to eat. One-tap random selection with intelligent filters + a unique "make at home" fallback with recipe links.

Looking for beta testers (Android users) to stress-test before public launch.

If you're interested in testing or just want to chat about the build process, hit me up!

## 🔥 Story/Hype Post

```
You know that moment when you and your friends can't decide where to eat?

"What do you want?"
"I don't know, what do you want?"
"I'm fine with anything"
"Me too"

*30 minutes later*

"Okay, let's just get McDonald's"

I GOT TIRED OF THAT. 😤

So I built ForkIt - an app that just PICKS A RESTAURANT FOR YOU.

Features:
🎲 True random selection (no algorithms trying to manipulate you)
✨ Hidden Gems mode (find LOCAL spots, not chains)
🏡 Can't decide if you want to go out? Get recipes to make it at home!

It's live on Android for beta testing!

Who wants in? Comment or DM!

Limited to 100 testers - first come, first served! 🏃‍♂️💨
